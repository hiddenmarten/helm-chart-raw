  A flexible Helm chart that allows you to define and render any Kubernetes resources directly in your values.yaml file.

  This chart provides a simple way to deploy custom resources without creating traditional Helm templates.

  ## Features

  - Deploy any Kubernetes resources by defining them in values.yaml
  - Full Helm templating support within your resource definitions

  ## Installation

  ```bash
  helm install my-release oci://ghcr.io/hiddenmarten/charts/raw
  ```

  ## Usage

  Define your Kubernetes resources in the `templates` array within your values.yaml file.
  Each item in the array should be a complete Kubernetes resource definition.

  ## Examples

  See the `examples/` directory for more usage examples:

    - `basic.yaml` - Simple ConfigMap and Service deployment

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: 0.0.4

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application. Versions are not expected to
# follow Semantic Versioning. They should reflect the version the application is using.
# It is recommended to use it with quotes.
